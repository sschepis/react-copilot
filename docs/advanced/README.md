# Advanced Usage

This section covers advanced usage patterns, customization options, security considerations, and integration techniques for React Copilot.

## Table of Contents

- [Security Considerations](security.md)
- [Version Control](version-control.md)
- [Component Registry](component-registry.md)
- [Plugin System](plugin-system.md)
- [State Management Integration](state-management.md)

- [Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md)
- [Testing](testing.md)

## Security Considerations

React Copilot includes several built-in security features to protect your application from potentially harmful changes:

- [Permission System](security.md#permission-system): Fine-grained control over what the LLM can modify
- [Code Validation](security.md#code-validation): Validation and sanitization of code before execution
- [Sandboxed Execution](security.md#sandboxed-execution): Safe execution environment for generated code
- [Error Boundaries](security.md#error-boundaries): Graceful fallbacks for problematic changes
- [Version Control](version-control.md): Ability to track and revert changes

## Component Registry

The Component Registry is the central system that tracks modifiable components, their properties, relationships, and version history. Understanding this system helps you to effectively manage large applications with many modifiable components.

See [Component Registry](component-registry.md) for detailed information.

## Plugin System

The Plugin System enables the extension of React Copilot's functionality without modifying the core library. Understanding plugin lifecycle, hooks, and the plugin manager helps you develop custom plugins or effectively use the built-in ones.

See [Plugin System](plugin-system.md) for detailed information.

## State Management Integration

React Copilot can integrate with popular state management solutions:

- [Redux Integration](state-management.md#redux)
- [MobX Integration](state-management.md#mobx)
- [Zustand Integration](state-management.md#zustand)
- [Context API Integration](state-management.md#context-api)

## Custom LLM Providers

You can extend React Copilot with custom LLM providers beyond the built-in ones (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek):

- [Creating Custom Providers](custom-llm-providers.md#creating-custom-providers)
- [Provider Adapter Interface](custom-llm-providers.md#provider-adapter-interface)
- [Integration Examples](custom-llm-providers.md#integration-examples)

## Performance Optimization

Learn how to optimize React Copilot for large applications:

- [Lazy Loading](performance-optimization.md#lazy-loading)
- [Component Chunking](performance-optimization.md#component-chunking)
